# Go Goroutines Example

This repository demonstrates the use of Go's Goroutines for concurrency. Each step builds upon the previous one, adding more complexity and functionality.

## Steps

### 1. Basic Functionality (`1.go`)
The basic function that speaks (prints) the words in a sentence.

### 2. Adding Concurrency (`2.go`)
Adds concurrency by using Goroutines to the code.

### 3. Adding WaitGroups (`3.go`)
Introduces WaitGroups to ensure that all Goroutines finish execution before the program exits.

### 4. Separating Business and Concurrency Logic (`4.go`)
Refactors the code to separate business logic from concurrency logic, improving maintainability.

### 5. Using Channels (`5.go`)
Incorporates Go Channels to manage communication between Goroutines efficiently.
